# Guides

This section provides practical, task-oriented information about how to use and
test the Flexibility Information System (FIS).  

The guides help users navigate FIS, understand how to
interact with the system, and use the available test data to verify workflows.

## Are you a new user?

[Getting Started](getting-started.md) explains how to log in to the FIS
environment, authenticate, and explore the graphical user interface.  

## Performing tests in FIS?

[Test Data](test-data.md) describes which parties and accounting points
can be used when performing tests in the FIS environment.
Using the correct data ensures that test cases run successfully and that results
can be validated.

## Getting ready to participate in the market?

[Get Ready for Market](get-ready-for-market.md) helps you get an overview
of how to go from initial setup in FIS to being ready for market participation.
It summarises the registration, validation, and approval steps needed before
you can deliver flexibility products.
