# Service provider switching initiated by the new service provider

The end user contacts a new service provider in order to obtain a new contract
for controllable unit services and ending of the contract with the present
service provider

## Prerequisites

- There exists a valid contract between the new service provider and the end
  user, and all contract requirements from the old contract have been met.
- The service provider acts on behalf of the end user.
- The contrallable unit business ID is known by new service provider. This ID
  must be provided by the end user.
- The controllable unit will remain with the old service providerâ€™s control and
  useable for operations until the contract start date for new service provider.
- Further update of CU data and assignment/removal of controllable
  unit to/from service providing group(s) is documented in dedicated
  processes.
