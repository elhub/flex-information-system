# SP Product Suspension

This process is used to suspend the service provider product qualification temporarily. The process can only be triggered by the procuring system operator that already qualified the service provider. The process also includes reinstatement of the service provider qualification, i.e. removing the suspension. 

Reasons for suspension can be:
* Communication issues
* System problems 
* Inactive metering point

The service provider will receive information about the suspension with reason for suspension. 
All procuring system operators and final customer will be notified of the suspension.
Other communication between service provider and system operator will happen outside of FIS.

The suspension of the SP qualification will impact [ready for market](https://elhub.github.io/flex-information-system/concepts/ready-for-market/).
