# Service Provider Contract Revocation and Termination

This process is used to terminate the service provider contract for the
controllable unit. The process can be triggered by one of the following:

- Service contract revocation by end user.
- Implicit contract termination triggered by the metering point administrator.
- Service contract termination by service provider.

## Prerequisites

- The service provider acts on behalf of the end user in all cases.
- In the event that FIS receives information about implicit contract
  termination, the end user's access to the affected controllable unit(s) will
  be revoked.
- The service provider must verify the information given by FIS when notified
  of an implicit contract termination.
- The service provider must update affected service providing groups.
