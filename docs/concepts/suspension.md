# Suspension

ACERs recommendation for NC DR has two mentions of "suspension procedures".

> Article 27
>
> (d) a ‘suspension procedure’ allowing system operators to suspend the
> qualification of a service provider, SPU or SPG;

and

> Article 28
>
> (c) a ‘suspension procedure’ allowing entitled parties to suspend controllable
> units and ensuring that all affected parties are notified
> [without undue delay];

What does it mean to suspend? The word has many nuances, but a good definition
is to stop something from being active.

The suspension can either be temporary or permanent, but the context of the ACER
recommendation suggests that it is *temporary* - for a *period of time*.

Another aspect of suspension is that it is *sometimes* considered as a
punishment because someone has done something wrong. We do *not* interpret
suspension to signal or exclusively be about sanctioning, but rather just a way
to enforce or convey temporary deactivation.

The definition of suspension also implies that it can be done both by the party
that is doing the activity (I am suspending my activity), but also by someone
else (You must suspend your activity). Our definition of suspension also follows
this logic.

In total, our definition of suspension is:

> Suspension is a temporary deactivation, and can be done by the party doing
> the activity or by another entitled party.

## Who can suspend?

Suspension can happen on all levels. It can be on both regular resources and the
one that represent relationships (like product applications).

| Level                   | Aka              | Who      | Comment                           |
|-------------------------|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| CU                      |                  | SP? CSO? | Implies unavailability??          |
| CU membership (in SPG)  |                  | SP?      | CU can not contribute to this SPG |
| SPG                     |                  | SP?      | SPG is unavailable for use        |
| SPG Product Application | Prequalification | SO       |                                   |
| SP Product Application  | Qualification    | SO       |                                   |
| SP                      | Approval         | RME      | Must techincally be done by FISO  |

Service providers can also suspend their activities by simply not participating
in the markets, but signalling suspension via FIS allows SOs to have a better
overview of the state of the flexible assets.
