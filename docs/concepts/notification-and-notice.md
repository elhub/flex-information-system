# Notification and notice

Notifications and notices are sent to relevant parties when something is created,
updated or deleted (or expired?). Notification and notice convey infomation to
parties about changes and required action in the Flexibility Information System
(FIS). They are sent in FIS to the relevant parties.

## Notification

Notifications are messages that inform parties when something is
created, updated or deleted in FIS. The notifications are sent to parties, not individuals.
The purpose of notifications is to convey information to enable parties to act according
to the business processes.

Notifications include the event type, event source and the time of the event that
has occured. Notifications also include a direct link to the update that caused
the notification.

The notification is cleared when the notification is aknowledged. Aknowledgement
lets FIS know that it has fulfilled its obligation to inform the party about the
change.

### Example of notification

When a procuring system operator [registers a new product type](../processes/system-operator-product-registration.md)
they intend to procure, a notification is sent to all approved service providers.
The reason why service providers receive the notification is so that they receive
information about a new market opportunity. The notification thus enables them to
act according to the the business processes by registering a product application.
Without the notification, the service providers would not have any information about
the new product type.

The reason why they receive a notification instead of a notice is because the
information does not require action from the service provider. Acting upon the received
information in the notification is optional.

## Notice

Notices are messages that are sent to relevant parties that require action
from the recipitent. Notice works as a task list for the recipient. The
purpose of notices is to inform parties about the actions that are required
from them. 

The notices include which party the notice is for, which type of notice it is
and the source of the notice. Notices also include a direct link to the update
that lead to the notice.

The notice is cleared when the required task is completed.
