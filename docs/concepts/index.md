# Concepts

This section focuses on **what** the concepts mean, not **how** they are implemented.

*Concepts* defines the main ideas and terms used in the Flexibility Information
System (FIS). The purpose is to provide a shared understanding of what the
core elements in the system represent, and to establish a common language
for everyone involved in developing, operating, and using FIS.

By defining concepts early, we ensure that discussions, design work, and
technical development build on the same foundation — even as the system
continues to evolve.  

!!! note "Under development"

    Some of the concepts described here are still under discussion or development. Additional concepts will also be
    added as the system evolves.

## Current concepts

### [Communication and Coordination](communication-and-coordination.md)

Describes how unstructured information is shared within and
across parties in FIS, that support collaboration and alignment around resources.

### [Conceptual Model and Terminology](conceptual-model.md)

Introduces the core concepts and relationships in FIS and how they
connect to each other. Provides the shared conceptual foundation for
understanding all other parts of the documentation.

### [End Users](end-user.md)

The owner of a controllable unit.

### [Grid Model](grid-model.md)

A simplified representation of the physical grid.

### [Notification and Notice](notification-and-notice.md)

Explains how FIS uses notifications and notices to inform parties about events
and highlight situations where action is required.

### [Ready for Market](ready-for-market.md)

Conditions for being ready to participate in flexibility markets.

### [Suspension](suspension.md)

A temporary deactivation of market participation.

### [Time Series](time-series.md)

Overview of time-series in the context of a flexibility value chain.

## Where to go next

If you want to learn more about how FIS works in practice, continue with:

- [Resources](../resources/index.md) – resources in the API.  
- [Guides](../guides/index.md) – GUI and test environment instructions.  
- Technical – architecture, integrations,
and system design.
