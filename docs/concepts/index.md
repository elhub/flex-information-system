# Concepts

This section focuses on **what** the concepts mean, not **how** they are implemented.

*Concepts* defines the main ideas and terms used in the Flexibility Information
System (FIS). The purpose is to provide a shared understanding of what the
core elements in the system represent, and to establish a common language
for everyone involved in developing, operating, and using FIS.

By defining concepts early, we ensure that discussions, design work, and
technical development build on the same foundation — even as the system
continues to evolve.  

!!! note "Under development"

    Some of the concepts described here are still under discussion or development. Additional concepts will also be
    added as the system evolves.

## Current concepts

### [End User](end-user.md)

The owner of the controllable unit.

### [Grid Model](grid-model.md)

A simplified representation of the physical grid.

### [Ready for Market](ready-for-market.md)

Conditions for being ready to participate in flexibility markets.

### [Suspension](suspension.md)

A temporary deactivation of market participation.

### [Time Series](time-series.md)

Overview of time-series in the context of a flexibility value chain.

## Where to go next

If you want to learn more about how FIS works in practice, continue with:

- **[Processes](../processes/index.md)** – workflows and interactions.  
- **[Resources](../resources/index.md)** – resources in the API.  
- **[Guides](../guides/index.md)** – GUI and test environment instructions.  
- **[Technical](../technical/index.md)** – architecture, integrations,
and system design.
