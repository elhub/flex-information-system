# Time Series

This document is an overview of time-series in the context of a flexibility
value chain. It is by no means exhaustive or final, but an attempt to capture
some important aspects and needs.

By time series we mean a sequence of data points collected, recorded or stored
at successive points in time, often at regular intervals. The value of a data
point is, in our context, electrical quantities.

## Types

Time series can be of different types. The following is the definition of the
types that we think are relevant in the context of a flexibility value chain.

There are other types of time series-like data that is highly relevant
for baselining or optimization but is not included because we believe
that it is not relevant for others in the value chain. Examples are
weather data, moving holidays, spot-prices, grid-tariffs and so on.

## Logical levels

Time series are usually linked to logical levels, typically the
resources we use to model the flexibility domain. These logical levels are:

- Service Providing Group (**SPG**) / Portfolio
- Accounting Point (**AP**) / Metering point (MP)
- Controllable Unit (**CU**) / Asset
- Technical Resource (**TR**)

## Origins

The origin of a time-series is the physical or concrete source of the data, i.e.
where it comes from. We are using this nomenclature to distinguish between the
different types of time-series origins.

| Origin                       | Abbr | Type        | Typical granularity      | Responsible                | Comment                                                                                                                               |

### DMD vs DM

[Regulation (EU) 2024/1747](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1747/oj/eng)
defines a Dedicated Measurement Device (DMD) as

> a device linked to or embedded in an asset that provides demand response or
> flexibility services on the electricity market or to system operators

We have chose to "split" this term in two, depending on the nature of the
measurement. If the measurement is a meter, i.e. a device that measures
cumulative flow of energy, then we call it a Dedicated Meter (DM).

### Measuring Instrument Directive (MID)

Directive 2014/32/EU is known as the
[Measuring Instrument Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_Instruments_Directive)
and outlines the requirements for a wide range of measuring instruments,
including active electrical energy meters. MID compliance means that the meter
gone through an independent conformity assessment.

## Characteristics

The nature of a time-series can vary greatly, some characteristics to
consider are

- **Granularity** - Time-resolution expressed as a duration like 1h,
  15m and similar
- **Quality** – e.g. is it measured or metered and accuracy of
  measurements and baselines
- **Reliability** – in the data stream
- **Frequency** – delay in the data stream
- **Timeline** – e.g. future or historic data
- **Audit** – essentially bi-temporal data

## Baselines

As defined above, a baseline is a counterfactual reference about the
electrical quantities that would have been withdrawn or injected if there had
been no activation of services.

Baseline can be calculated on any logical level or origin, depending on the use.
It is typically the service provider that has access to the most reliable (and
possibly market sensitive) data that can be used to calculate an accurate
baseline. They also often know the most about the assets general usage patterns.
In situations where there is other loads on the same accounting point, it is
unlikely that the service provider (or anyone else for that matter) can
calculate a baseline that is accurate enough to be used for settlement.

Depending on method, baseline can also be calculated by another party, but that
might require data from the service provider to be transferred in advance.

The fundamental problem with a baseline is that it is not possible to verify its
correctness - it is counterfactural after all. We must rather determine a
strategy that helps us to agree that the baseline is trustworthy or acceptable.
There some main strategies to do this that can be used on their own or in combination:

- **Standard method** - calculated using a standard, deterministic, agreed-upon
  method where input data is trusted and the calculation can be repeted at any
  point in time.
- **Auditable method** - calculated using a method that can be audited, e.g. by
  providing the input data and method.
- **Trusted party** - calculated by a trusted (third-)party with no vested
  interest in the outcome
- **Validate over time** - calculated and communicated ahead-of-time and
  validated continiously/over time by comparing it to actual metered values when
  no trade is going on. This requires that the baseline is calculated
  continously.

Each of these strategies allows different methods of calculating baselines as
well as put different requirements on the systems and the service provider.

### Baseline methods

The following sections outline some of the methods that can be used to calculate
baselines. These are methods that has been surfaced in our work group
discussions.

#### Black box

The baseline is calculated using a unspecified method that is concidered a "black
box" by the value chain. This is typically done by the service provider (SP), potentially
based on confidential input, using a proprietary algorithm.

The black box method is the one that allows for the most innovation and allows
the SP to use the best available data and methods, e.g. machine learning.
However, it is also the most opaque and ensuring trust in this baseline can only
be done by validating it over time.

#### Meter before

The "Meter before" method uses the metered values before the activation as the
baseline. This method should use the metered values for the same time period as
the Imbalance Settlement Period (ISP) - 1h or 15m - as values typically will
fluctuate between the ISPs.

#### Meter before and after

Similar to the "Meter before" method, but uses an average of the metered values
before and after.

#### Sliding window

A sliding window baseline is a baseline that is calculated using a sliding
window of historical data. The window is typically a fixed time period, e.g.
the last 5 days, and the baseline is calculated using the data in that window.

This method can also use other inputs such as weather data, holidays,
and other factors that can impact the consumption or production of energy.

#### Zero

The baseline is set to zero. Could be useful e.g. for fossil fuel generators or
batteries. It can only be used if the asset is in contracted to not consume and/or
produce energy for the periods it is part of a reservation contract.

## Quantification and verification

When establishing how much flex has been delivered we conceptually split the
activity in two: *quantification* and *verification*. These look very similar -
and can sometime be one and the same - but does have different purposes.

### Quantification

Quantification is the continious activity of calculating the activated volume after
*each and every* activation. The purpose of quantification is to be able to do
settlement of the activated volume.

There are three main methods for quantifying the activated volume:

- **Assumed delivery** - where the activated volume is assumed to be the
  same as what was traded in the market.
- **Baseline comparison** - where the activated volume is calculated by comparing
  the baseline to the metered values.
- **Reported delivery** - where the activated volume is reported by the
  service provider based on agreed upon terms.

Quantification is done to support three types of settlement:

- **Quantification for service settlement** - must end up on the SPG
  level since that is where the bids are.
- **Quantification for imbalance adjustment and financial transfer** - must be
  done at the level of accounting point (AP) or lower (CU/TR). NOTE - See the
  section
  [Non- or over-consumed energy due to activation of flexibility](#non--or-over-consumed-energy-due-to-activation-of-flexibility)
  for more details about imbalance settlement.
- **Quantification for end user compensation** - must be done at the level of
  the accounting point (AP) or lower (CU/TR), since that is where the end user
  is linked. While it is the service provider that is responsible for this and
  has the agreement with the end user, it is important that any potential
  flexibility volumes shown in a flexibility information system matches the
  quantities that SP is using to compensate the end user, to avoid confusion and
  distrust.

For some assets it is easy and practical to quantify the activated volume on
the CU or AP level, e.g. a single battery facility or large boilers.

For other cases, such as a group of many small assets, it might not be practical
to quantify the activated volume on the CU/AP level. By quantifying on the SPG
level, we can use the "law of large numbers" to get a good prediction of the
baseline (and thus the activated volume). Also, if quantification is done using
the *assumed delivery* method, then the quantification happens on the SPG level
per definition.

Having consistent quantification (e.i. the quantification "add up" between the
levels) can follow one one of two main strategies:

- **aggregate** - *sum* - quantification is done on the lower level, e.g. CU or
  TR, and then aggregated to the SPG level.
- **allocate** - *split* . the quantification is done on the SPG level and then
  allocated to the lower levels, using some kind of distribution factor.

Allocation can be done with:

- fixed factors
    - even split
    - per SPG
- dynamic factors
    - assigned by SP per bid/activation - this required [activation data](#activation-data)
    - assigned by doing an approximate quantification on the lower level

### Verification

Verification is the process where the system operator verifies the
quantified volume and that the service was delivered in compliance with the
product requirements of the specific products.

This verification can be done for every trade or activation, but it is also
appropriate to do this once at application time and then ad-hoc or at certain
intervals during the lifetime of the service providing group.

The verification might include

- comparing the quantified volume to what is observed in the accounting point
- getting additional data from the service provider - e.g. high granularity data

It is at the system operator's discretion to decide how and when to verify the
service delivery, as long as it does not put an additional/undue burden on the
service provider.

## Activation data

Activation data is the data related to an activation of a flexible resource. For
manual activation markets this is bid acceptance. For automatic reserves it is
when thresholds for delivering service was met. It includes information about

- activated volume
- time period
- service providing group

To be able to quantify the activated volume for imbalance settlement, we might
need to know, after the delivery of service, which CU that was actually
activated. This can be:

- simple boolean - `yes`/`no`
- an actual contribution factor

## Non- or over-consumed energy due to activation of flexibility

Activation of balancing and local services from *fully* *independent* service
providers impacts the balance responsible party (BRP) and energy supplier (ES)
on the accounting point(s) financially. Non-consumed or over-consumed energy can
result in a financial loss or gain depending on prices, direction of activation
and original balance of the BRP.

The BRP and ES will be impacted in two ways:

- **Financial** - due to less/more energy sold/bought
- **Imbalance settlement** - since the balance of the BRP will be affected by
  the activated volume

The imbalance settlement impact is of course also financial and sometimes work
in “opposite direction” to the direct financial one. We should consider and
handle the impacts independently since prices are different and impact is on ES
vs BRP.

How to handle this in DSO markets is still pending regulation, and the current
approach in the EuroFlex pilot is to *do nothing*. The current situation is also
that a large majority of service providers are BRPs, and not independent.

In the TSO market, a split between roles for Balance Service Provider (BSP) and
BRP is underway. This is not a fully independent service provider, but a small
first step in that direction. Mitigation of the impact on imbalance settlement
will be handled with *imbalance adjustment*, where the imbalance caused by
activation is adjusted in the settlement. The financial impact will be handled
by requiring *bi-lateral agreements* between BSP and the BRP. Also, all bids
will be required to be with the same BRP.

Centrally done *financial transfer*, where money is transferred between the
parties, based on a set price (spot), is another way to mitigate the financial
impact. A more elaborate method, called *financial compensation*, could consider
the actual cost of the BRP and compensate that.

One could also envision using the markets to mitigate the impacts. The BRP could
be notified about activation and do intra-day trading to “cover the difference".
The (D)SO could be required to make a *counter-activation,* i.e. an activation
in the opposite direction to ensure system balance This could be used to
mitigate the impacts if the counter-activation is for the correct BRP/ES. It
will be close to impossible to ensure that as it will require additional methods
for handling impact.

The methods described in this section are summarized in the table below. The
columns *imbalance settlement* and *financial* show if the methods are
applicable to mitigate that specific impact.

</table>

We believe that the most interesting methods to pilot for local
flexibility markets and a common national flexibility register are *do
nothing,* *imbalance adjustment* and *financial transfer*. It is
ultimately regulation that will decide, but we can investigate if
centrally handled imbalance adjustment and financial transfer is
feasible at a reasonable complexity/cost.

## Challenges

The following are some challenges that has been identified and must be
addressed but are not directly in scope to “solve” in this overview.

### Data privacy

The higher the granularity of data, the more sensitive it becomes. This is
relevant only for personal data, i.e. values tied to a private address or a sole
proprietorship company.

### Data access and flow

Securing every entitled party access to time-series is one of the challenges we
must solve. Does it flow via a Flexibility Information System (FIS), directly
between the involved parties or via some other platform/mechanism.

### Clock drift

If the time of different meter and measurement equipment is not in sync, then
using those values together will produce incorrect results.

### Granularity and frequency of AMS data

The AMS meters are considered of high integrity, but the lack of 15-minute data
and delay in when the data is available via Elhub makes it less ideal to use for
planning and baselining.

## Needs

The rest of this document contains tables describing needs for different
time-series in the flexibility value chain, based on the different aspects
highlighted above.

In short:

- **Who** – needs and has data
- **What** – the needs are

We are making up some roles/responsibilities that is currently not defined
elsewhere but since it is undefined who will do it, we single them out for
clarity.

- Baseline provider – the party responsible for creating the baseline for a
  given (group of) asset(s)
- Activated volume calculator – the party responsible for calculating activated
  volume

This document does **not** intend to specify any *technical
requirements* to data interchange formats, though we should not be
scared of recording some details, e.g. about current
implementation/requirements.

We generally want to express needs in a user-story like format. However,
it also makes sense to structure the data in tabular format for easier
filtering and mental processing.

As such, we have tried to specify tables that accommodate something that
looks like a [Five Ws user story
template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) like phrase.

> As `<who>`, I want `<need/level/resolution/frequency>` because
> `<purpose>`

Some abbreviations

- **ISP** – imbalance settlement period (1h / 15 m)

        Baseline and activated is calculated on the SPG level, then the
        activated is “distributed” on the CUs via some key/algorithm.
