# Controllable Unit

A controllable unit is defined as "a single power-generating module and/or
demand unit" in
[public consultation on the draft network code on demand response](https://www.acer.europa.eu/documents/public-consultations/pc2024e07-public-consultation-draft-network-code-demand-response).

The controllable unit is connected to a single accounting point. This
restriction is there to provide a unambiguous connection between the
controllable unit and the balance responsible party of the energy supplier. This
enables us to do imbalance adjustment.

The accounting point is also used to determine the locational information of the
controllable unit.

## Business Identifiers

Controllable units are identified by a UUID. UUID are simple and easy to
generate and requires no coordination with external bodies (like GS1 or
ENTSO-E). It is a un-complicated way to ensure uniqueness.

The UUIDs are generated by the system when a CU is created.

## Status transitions for grid validation

The following diagram shows the transitions for the grid validation status of
controllable units.
It normally starts as `pending`, then the system operator takes over to conclude
on their validation or signal that information is missing.
On any change to a technical information on a controllable unit or one of its
technical resources, the grid validation status is reset if not already
`pending` or `in_progress`.

## Status transitions for controllable unit

The following diagram shows the status and its transitions for controllable
unit.
The Service Provider is responsible for creating a new controllable unit.
Initially, the status is set to "new." Once the CU registration is complete, the
Service Provider updates the status to "active." After termination, the status
can only be edited by a FIS operator.
