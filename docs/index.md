# Introduction

You are now reading a the documentation for the Flexibility Information System
that is part of the EuroFlex project. The sub-project is lead and done by
Elhub AS.

!!! note "Work in progress"

    This documentation is a work in progress. Do not consider any of the details
    here as final or complete.

!!! warning

    The Flexibility Information System is a prototype. As such, even though it
    offers authentication and authorisation features, it should _not_ be
    considered as a production-level system. Please make sure the data used
    while testing is _fictitious_ and does not contain _any_ sensitive
    information (_e.g._, health data, sexual orientation, _etc_).

    Our system stores read-only
    [historical data](./technical/time.md#record-time) for some of its
    resources. This means that wrong data will remain in the system
    even though the last version of the resource is corrected.
    Should you inadvertently add sensitive data to a resource, please
    [contact us](mailto:post@elhub.no) so that we can manually clean the
    problematic records.
