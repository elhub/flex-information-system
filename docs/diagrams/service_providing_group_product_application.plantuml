note over SO
    The PSO must simplify the prequalification and
    possibly only do a verification if:

    The SPG is previously prequalified for the same
    product type by another PSO.

    OR

    The SPG exclusively consists of small CUs,
    CUs that are identical to CUs being part
    of other SPGs previously prequalified by
    any SP/SO for the same product type,
    or a combination of both.
