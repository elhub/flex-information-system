    """Data schema - The relation between a party and entity.

    Attributes:
        scopes (Union[Unset, list[AuthScope]]): List of scopes granted to the entity when it acts as the party. Scopes
            are inspired from OAuth 2.0 and allow refinement of access control and privilege delegation mechanisms. Example:
            ['read:data'].
        party_id (Union[Unset, int]): Reference to the party that the membership links to an entity. Example: 379.
        entity_id (Union[Unset, int]): Reference to the entity that the party represents. Example: 30.
        recorded_at (Union[Unset, str]): When the resource was recorded (created or updated) in the system. Example:
            2023-12-31 23:59:00 CET.
        recorded_by (Union[Unset, int]): The identity that recorded the resource. Example: 145.
        id (Union[Unset, int]): Unique surrogate identifier. Example: 44.
