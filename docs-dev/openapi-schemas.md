# Structure of JSON schemas in the OpenAPI documentation

The JSON schemas describing the resources in the OpenAPI documentation are
generated mainly from the `resources.yml` file, by running the
`template_to_openapi.py` script.

We try as much as possible not to repeat ourselves in this document.
In particular, fields of a given resource should be defined only once, and if
fields are in common between several API endpoints, this should be reflected in
the use of _inclusion_ between the underlying JSON schemas.
This documentation helps the developer understand how the JSON schemas are
structured, and also allows them to walk through and maintain the script
generating them more easily.

## Primer

In the resource YAML file, fields can be marked namely in the following manners:

| Marker        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x-no-update` | _Non-updatable_ field. Used for stuff that can/must be given on create, but that cannot be changed after. `x-` marker because this is non-standard OpenAPI and is just used during the generation process. |
| `readOnly`    | _Read-only_ field. Used for non-updatable fields that cannot be created by the API clients.                                                                                                                |
| `nullable`    | _Nullable_ field.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `default`     | Field with a _default value_.                                                                                                                                                                              |

In addition, we define _required_ fields as the following:

> NOT read only
> AND NOT nullable
> AND NO default value
> AND NOT explicitely marked `required: false`

This allows not having to define `required` everywhere and rather infer it from
more meaningful information that we make explicit in the resource YAML file.

## JSON schema structure

With the previous information, we can now show the structure of JSON schemas
generated by our script:

![Structure for OpenAPI schemas](./diagrams/openapi-schemas.drawio.png)

| Schema          | OpenAPI name                | Contains                                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Update**      | `[resource]_update_request` | All properties _except_ the _non-updatable_ and _read-only_ ones |
| **Create data** | `[resource]_create_data`    | **Update** schema + _non-updatable_ fields                       |
| **Create**      | `[resource]_create_request` | **Create data** schema + marking _required_ fields               |
| **Response**    | `[resource]_response`       | **Create data** schema + _read-only_ fields (including audit)    |

Sometimes, there is no create operation for the resource.
In such cases, we simply do not generate the **Create** schema, so that the
OpenAPI linter does not reject our generated OpenAPI specification because of
unused schemas.
We still generally keep the base structure with **Update** and **Create data**
so the generation is more uniform across all resources.
