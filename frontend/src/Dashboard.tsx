            The Flexibility Information System is a prototype. As such, even
            though it offers authentication and authorisation features, it
            should <i>not</i> be considered as a production-level system. Please
            make sure the data used while testing is <i>fictitious</i> and does
            not contain <i>any</i> sensitive information (<i>e.g.</i>, health
            data, sexual orientation, <i>etc</i>).
            <br />
            <br />
            Our system stores read-only{" "}
            <a href={`${docsURL}/time/#record-time`}>historical data</a> for
            some of its resources. This means that wrong data will remain in the
            system even though the last version of the resource is corrected.
            Should you inadvertently add sensitive data to a resource, please{" "}
            <a href="mailto:post@elhub.no">contact us</a> so that we can
            manually clean the problematic records.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a test system, it is also subject to frequent updates, and
            therefore, server resets. Please keep in mind that the data inserted
            into the system may be lost at any time.
          </Alert>
          <p>
            Check the <a href={`${docsURL}/guides/getting-started`}>tutorial</a>{" "}
