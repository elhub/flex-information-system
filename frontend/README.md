# flex-admin

This is a prototype front-end for the Flexibility Information System.
At this stage of the project, the front-end should be as simple as possible,
and rely mainly on automated tools, so that we can explore simple functional
scenarios and make our specification evolve without getting lost in
front-end-specific implementation details.
We therefore rely on [React-Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) for now.
